This repo will walk you through how to access the HMS O2 Cluster, access our protein design tools, activate the necessary dependencies and finally how to design de novo mini binders! 



# Getting Access to the Cluster


Open Terminal and login to your user-specific login node:
<pre> ssh <Your_HMS_ID>@o2.hms.harvard.edu </pre>

You can then navigate to our software folder located at this directory:

<pre> cd /n/data1/hms/wyss/collins/lab/software </pre>
