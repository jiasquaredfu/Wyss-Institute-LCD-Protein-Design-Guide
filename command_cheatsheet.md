# Navigating Terminal with Linux

Before starting any computational work, having basic familiarity with Unix/Linux will allow you to navigate and interact with all the software you will use! Going into your Terminal and testing out these commands is a good way to get some hands-on practice. 

| Linux/VIM Command  | Function                                                |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `ls`                     | show contents of current directory                      |
| `cd <folder_name>`       | move into folder                                        |
| `cd ..`                  | move out of folder                                      |
| `pwd`                    | show current directory file path                        |
| `mv <file_name> <new_location>` | move file to new location                           |
| `mvdir <folder_name> <new_location>` | move folder to new location                     |
| `rm <file_name>`         | remove file                                             |
| `rmdir <folder_name>`    | remove folder                                           |
| `vi <file_name>`         | open VIM editor (press "i" key to enter editing mode)  |
| `:wq`                    | save and quit file                                      |
| `:q`                     | quit file without saving                                |
